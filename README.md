# Firefox Color

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mozilla/FirefoxColor.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/FirefoxColor.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mozilla/FirefoxColor)

## Get Started

1. Install Node 8.9.4+ (e.g. using [node version manger][nvm])

1. Clone the repo, install dependencies, start the dev environment:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mozilla/FirefoxColor.git
   cd FirefoxColor
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a webpack-dev-server instance at port 8080 and start a
   watcher that will rebuild the browser extension with every file change.

1. In Firefox 57 + open `about:debugging` and load the
   `build/extension/manifest.json` file.

1. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the web-based theme editor - changes
   should be relayed through the temporarily installed add-on and alter the
   browser theme

**Note:** If you have problems seeing the editor at `http://localhost:8080/` on
your computer, it's possible that you already have some other service using
port 8080. You can change the port that Firefox Color uses for local development:

* For Linux & OS X: `PORT=9090 npm start`
* For Windows: `.\node_modules\.bin\cross-env PORT=9090 npm start`

This example switches to port 9090, but you can supply a different port as
needed.

## Environment variables

There are a few environment variables used in building the site and extension
that are handy to know about:

- `PORT` - (default: `8080`) Port at which the webpack dev server will start up
- `NODE_ENV` - (default: `production`) setting to `development` will enable some features for development work 
- `SITE_URL` - (default: `http://localhost:8080`) the URL where the web app is hosted
- `SITE_ID` - (default: empty string) the ID of the site for the extension - e.g. "", "local", "stage", "dev"
- `DOWNLOAD_FIREFOX_UTM_SOURCE` - host name used in metrics when the button to download Firefox is clicked
- `LOADER_DELAY_PERIOD` - (default: `2000`) delay in ms used for web site loader, can be set to `0` during development to make the site appear faster but with visual glitches

## Build & Release

Deploying a development release consists of pushing to the `development` branch
on this repo. Production release consists of pushing to the `production` branch.

The script `npm run release:dev` in `package.json` takes care of the following:

* Sets the `SITE_URL` var to point at mozilla.github.io/FirefoxColor

* Sets the `ADDON_URL` var to point at https://addons-dev.allizom.org/firefox/addon/firefox-color/

* Build the site

* Build & sign the add-on

* Copy the signed add-on into the site

* Deploy the site to Github Pages

Signing depends on [`WEB_EXT_API_KEY` and `WEB_EXT_API_SECRET` environment
variables being set for use by `web-ext sign`][sign]. Deployment depends on
[`GH_TOKEN` being set with a personal access token from GitHub][ghtoken]. These
are currently configured in CircleCI to support deployment after successful
test runs.

[sign]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/web-ext_command_reference#web-ext_sign

## Build, test and publish add-on
The script `npm run xpi` in `package.json` generates unsigned xpi files, which
are added to `build/web` (and published to the root of `SITE_URL` by CircleCI),
on all branches (development, stage, production). These XPIs can be loaded at
`about:debugging` for manual testing.

- `firefox-color-stage-unsigned.xpi` - test with Stage (testing only).
- `firefox-color-unsigned.xpi` - test with Production (release candidate).

After passing QA, the XPI can be published by manually uploading it to AMO.
Every release requires a version bump, because version numbers cannot be reused.
